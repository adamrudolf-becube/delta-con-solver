# delta-con-solver

An old code added to GitHub years later it was written.

I used this code for my [masters thesys](http://adamrudolf.web.elte.hu/MSc_szakdolgozat.pdf) as a helper.

Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way. As I remember I used Visual Studio to develop it.
