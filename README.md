# delta-con-solver

An old code added to GitHub years later it was written.

Despite of the name it doesn't implement the DeltaCon algorith, but contains classes for the statistical comparison of graphs. Calculates the overlap of edges, and correlation of degree distributions among other basic statistical data.

I used this code for my [masters thesys](http://adamrudolf.web.elte.hu/MSc_szakdolgozat.pdf) as a helper.

Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way. As I remember I used Visual Studio to develop it.
